# Description
As part of our second group project, we decided to capitalize on the concept of a robust instant messenger that allows the user to communicate with family and friends with tropical colors that are easy on the eyes . We designed this app with simplicity in mind and implemented a user friendly interface that skips the clutter and get straight to the point. So if you're like us, hate dull imessage features and cannot wait till we can see our friends in person again, your chat room awaits you. Welcome to Aloha Instant Messenger.
